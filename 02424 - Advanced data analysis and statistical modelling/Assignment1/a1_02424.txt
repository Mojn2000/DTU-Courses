Problem A
	Ex1
		From cor plot we propose 3 models:
			1: insulation = outdoor_temp
			2: insulation_sex = outdoor_temp
			3: insulation_sex = outdoor_temp + indoor_temp


Quesiton to Jan:
What exactly is meant by "weighted analysis???" Seems to be wls, but how do you want that???
How are we supposed to plot conf intervals in 3d???
