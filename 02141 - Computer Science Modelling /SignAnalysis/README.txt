Make sure you have read the instructions on how to use the FSLexYacc, and it is up and running in the cmd as discribed in the assignment discribtion.

Start by invoking the document called CalculatorLexer

Then invoke the CalculatorParser

Then finally run the SignAnalysis.fsx file, which is a F# file, so make sure you have F# in your path.

Then it will ask for the Guarded commands and it will run the sign analysis.
