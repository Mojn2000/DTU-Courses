Make sure you have read the instructions on how to use the FSLexYacc, and it is up and running in the cmd as discribed in the assignment discribtion.

Start by invoking the document called CalculatorLexer

Then invoke the CalculatorParser

Then finally run the GrafGenerator.fsx file, which is a F# file, so make sure you have F# in your path.

The programme will ask you to enter guarded commands language, and it will output the programme-graph corresponding to the guarded commands you have entered.

OBS: For some reason our F# interpreter were unable to handle the starting and ending triangles, therefore we have decided to call our starting state q_start and end state q_end.
