# DTU Homework Assignments

Welcome to my repository of master's degree homework assignments! This collection showcases my efforts and learning throughout my studies in Mathematical Engineering at DTU (Danish Technical University).

Disclaimer: **Please note that the solutions provided in this repository are for reference and learning purposes only. Submitting these solutions as your own may violate academic integrity policies. There are no guarantees of correctness, and I encourage you to understand the concepts and solve the assignments on your own.**

## Getting Started

To explore the homework assignments, you can simply clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

Make sure you have Git installed on your system.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each course's homework assignments. Feel free to navigate through the folders to find the assignments that interest you.

## Usage

Each assignment is contained within its own directory and may include relevant files, such as code, data, or documentation. You can use these assignments as references or sources of inspiration to enhance your understanding of the subjects covered. However, I strongly encourage you to solve the assignments independently to maximize your learning experience.

## Questions and Discussions

If you have any questions, need clarifications, or would like to discuss any of the assignments or related topics, please feel free to contact me directly (mads.esben.hansen@gmail.com). I am always open to engaging in discussions and helping fellow learners.
