Homework assignment 1. 

The homework assignment consists of two parts:

Part one: Exercise 10 from Chapter 1. Make sure to explain intermediate steps to a reasonable amount.

Part two: Answer the following questions:

(a) Let n,m be positive integers such that m is less than or equal to n. Further denote by (S_n, o ) the symmetric group on n letters. How many distinct m-cycles does S_n contain? You should prove your answer is correct, so remember to explain your reasoning and give intermediate steps whenever necessary.

(b) How many distinct permutations of the form (a b) (c d), with (a b) and (c d) disjoint 2-cycles, does S_n contain? As above, you should prove that your answer is correct.
